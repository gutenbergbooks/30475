<p class="rgt">October 10, 2119<br />
New San Francisco</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Today</span>, at precisely 9:50
a.m., Kyle became First
Imperator of Terra. His
coup was so fantastically direct
and facile that I am almost
tempted to believe that old cliche
"the time was right."</p>

<p>Well, however badly it can be
expressed, I suppose the world
<i>was</i> ripe for this sort of thing. I
can remember when much the
same used to happen in elections.
One man would win over another
by a tremendous majority, and
historians would then set about
to show how "the time was right."</p>

<p>Why do I persist in tormenting
myself with that phrase! Analytically,
I might say I resent this
new aristocracy of politics. Specifically,
I might say I resent
Kyle.</p>

<p>And both are true, both are
true.</p>

<p>This swing, though, to absolute
monarchy, complete with the installation
of the Kyle Dynasty&mdash;damn
him! This is something
which psychologists, not historians,
must explain. Has the age
of the Common Man, so bravely
flaunted for over one hundred
years, truly come to nothing?
Would people really prefer a figurehead
and a symbol of undisputed
authority?</p>

<p>In this instance, one may again
conclude that "the time was
right." Contact with planets like
Mars and Venus undoubtedly had
its influence. I must confess that
the televised audiences with the
Mrit of Venus and the Znam of
Mars <i>did</i> make Terra's President&mdash;I
should say, late President&mdash;look
a bit seedy. I daresay there
is such a thing as a too common
Common Man.</p>

<p>Kyle was such, twenty years
ago. His name wasn't Kyle then,
although it was something very
like that. I must see if any of the
old ledgers are about! I'd like to
see what the Imperator's name
was when His Most Imperial
Majesty was an apprenticed nobody!</p>

<hr />

<p class="rgt">October 12, 2119<br />
New San Francisco</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;found</span> it! Buried in stacks
of dust behind the old printing
press that was once the heart
of my <i>Beacon-Sentinel</i>. There
were others there too. Spent a
delightful morning with them,
reading back through those old
account books.</p>

<p>I wonder whatever happened to
Hastings? And Drew? Best linotype
men I ever had. They became
pilots, or something, as I
recall. Too bad, too bad. They
could have had such brilliant
futures, both of them. Why they
felt they must ally themselves
with the non-thinking, muscle-flexing
variety of mankind&mdash;of
which our Ruler is an excellent
example&mdash;I'll never know.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, Kyle! In those days
he was Kilmer Jones. I don't remember
him too well, actually,
except for the day I fired him.</p>

<p>I suppose he was right in
changing his name. We couldn't
very well have an Imperator
named Kilmer the First, or Jones
the First. Much too common, not
at all in keeping.</p>

<p>Gawky fellow&mdash;that Kilmer.
When Bard brought me a sample
of his work&mdash;I guess I'll have to
call it that&mdash;we both had a good
laugh over it! Atrocious spelling!
Couldn't follow the proofreader's
marks. Indeed, I wonder if the
fellow could even read! The
punctuation! And the grammar!</p>

<p>I called the boy to the office
that morning&mdash;or was it the next
day? No matter. I called him in
and told him, as kindly as possible,
that I thought there were
other vocations to which he might
be better suited. The irony of it!
Kilmer Jones&mdash;Kyle I!</p>

<p>And he stood there, I remember,
with those seventeen-year-old
hands that were all knuckles
and bone and chapped skin,
twisting those hands and shifting
his weight from one foot to the
other.</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Booth," he said,
his voice cracking. "I ain't got no
other job in mind. I wanna be a
noospaper man. I ain't got no&mdash;"</p>

<p>If not for that "ain't got no," I
think I might have relented. But
no one is going to ruin the English
language as he did! Not in
my offices!</p>

<p>I took him to task severely for
his offensive usage, outlined a
correct example of what he had
attempted to say, gave him a
brief lesson in the history of the
tongue, and explained why it had
been chosen as the official Terran
speech. I think my conclusion
was, "You'll be much better off
in a position which requires you
to quote neither Milton nor
Shakespeare nor any author save
possibly those who write the
comic strips."</p>

<p>"Got no training," he said
softly. (I supposed it was to keep
his voice from exhibiting its
usual adolescent gymnastics.)</p>

<p>I shuddered slightly, I remember.
"You mean, 'I <i>have</i> no training.'"</p>

<p>"Yeah ..." softly again. "Yeah,
Mr. Booth."</p>

<p>"<i>Yes!</i>" I cried impatiently.
"Not 'yeah,' but <i>yes</i>!"</p>

<p>I searched for his severance pay
on my desk, wondering who the
devil had hired him in the first
place. Gave him three weeks pay,
as I recall it, one more than
necessary.</p>

<p>Unmannerly pup! He just stood
there for a minute and then finally
left without even a "Thank
you," or "Good-by."</p>

<p>And this is the man who is
Kyle the First, Ruler of Terra at
the age of thirty-seven! I wonder
what he is like now....</p>

<hr />

<p class="rgt">January 1, 1<br />
New San Francisco</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">There</span> is no longer any need
to wonder. Surprisingly few
heads have rolled, but apparently
Jonesy chooses to exhibit his
power in other ways.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day, a custom
preserved in certain portions of
the Directorate of North America,
is three weeks away&mdash;even
though it is January.</p>

<p>The Year One. There used to
be some childish joke about the
Year One. Don't remember it just
now.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving harvest in January.
Christmas celebration in
February. Spring planting in
July! To say nothing of the inconvenience
this has caused in
my bookkeeping department! I
suppose the man will now try to
change the weather to suit his
new calendar!</p>

<hr />

<p class="rgt">January 8, 1<br />
New San Francisco</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He</span> can't last! He can't! A dictator
is one thing. A monarch is
another. But Kyle is something
else!</p>

<p>Naturally he had to remove
certain persons from his way. And
his summer palace in the plains
region of America&mdash;that's all
right, that's all right! An authority
of Kyle's stature is expected
to remove undesirables,
and to have a summer palace,
and a winter palace, and anything
else he wants! Of course!</p>

<p>But why this? Why <i>this</i> of all
things!</p>

<p>No newspapers! Just like that!
<i>He</i> waves an edict, and just like
that, <i>no newspapers</i>! The <i>Beacon-Sentinel</i>
has been a great paper
for the last twenty-five years! It
was nothing, and I was nothing,
and together we became a Voice!
And now again, we are nothing!</p>

<p>Oh, I see what's behind it! It's
revenge, that's what it is! Because
he once couldn't become a
"noospaper" man, he's taking his
vengeance this way.</p>

<p>A man as petty as that shall
be overthrown! Mark my words!
And the clumsiness of it!</p>

<p>I see what he is! I know him!
He's still that pup of seventeen,
playing king with the world,
twisting his hands in glee over his
childish triumph.</p>

<p>No subtlety! Just a direct
pushing over an applecart he
couldn't steer! Doesn't matter
whose apples you destroy, does
it, Jonesy? Just push it over&mdash;push
it over!</p>

<hr />

<p class="rgt">January 16, 1<br />
New San Francisco</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Closed</span> the <i>Beacon-Sentinel</i>
yesterday. My savings are enough
to take care of me for a few
years. After that&mdash;ah, well, I am
no longer a young man. I am
glad that Elsa is not here to see
this.</p>

<hr />

<p class="rgt">February 12, 1<br />
New San Francisco</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Received</span> a letter this morning,
requesting me to appear
at the chambers of His Most
Imperial Majesty, Kyle the First,
on Tuesday of next week. His
Most Imperial Majesty can see
me between 10:15 and 10:25 on
that morning.</p>

<p>Ten minutes&mdash;rather a brief
spell in which to roll another
head.</p>

<p>I find myself amazed, though.
Is this man so truly powerful
that he needs no police to make
his arrests for him? Can he really
send messages via jetmail and be
certain his enemies will not try
to escape?</p>

<p>I don't want to attempt flight.
Life without my work is no longer
life.</p>

<hr />

<p class="rgt">February 17, 1<br />
Kyleton Palace, North America</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;don't</span> understand. I've gone
over it twice, and I don't
understand. If only Elsa were
still with me! I could talk to her.
She would help me decipher what
it's all about.</p>

<p>This morning, at 10:15 sharp,
I was taken to the public audience
chamber in the palace.</p>

<p>His Majesty was seated behind
a desk facing the doors. Behind
him, on the wall, was His
Coat of Arms.</p>

<p>He stood up and walked toward
me, waving away the
guards. "How are you, Mr.
Booth?" he said. And offered me
His Hand!</p>

<p>I recovered my presence of
mind, of course, and replied as
was fitting.</p>

<p>And then He said it! "I shall
be at liberty later this week to
discuss more fully the details of
these past years." (Shades of
"ain't got no!") "Meanwhile, my
secretary will give you a complete
dossier on my planned Official
Bulletin." He lighted a cigarette
after offering me one. "I
should deem it an honor," he continued,
"to have a man of your
literary versatility and&mdash;I must
add&mdash;your vast practical experience
become Chief Editor of that
Bulletin. The publication, which
I should enjoy christening <i>The
Terran Beacon-Sentinel</i>&mdash;with
your permission, sir&mdash;shall be
more than my official organ. It
shall set the standards for the
coming newspaper world."</p>

<p>He cocked an eyebrow at me
and smiled. "I believe we are in
perfect accord about certain
standards, are we not, Mr.
Booth? The deplorable grammatical
practices of some newspapers!
Well, really, Mr. Booth! I
feel assured of your agreement!"</p>

<p>He led me around the desk and
pointed to the Coat of Arms. As
He stood silent, I felt obliged to
look more closely. I had seen it
before, of course, but seeing it
now, greatly enlarged, I was able
to make out its detail.</p>

<p>What I had thought was a mere
decorative border, I now realized
was a motif I have seen all my
life! A tiny lighthouse sending
forth a beam! The trademark of
my paper!</p>

<p>As I stood there, gaping, His
Majesty laughed softly and said,
"That, Mr. Booth, I felt impelled
to include. For, without your
most fortuitous termination of
my apprenticeship in your organization,
I should not have
risen to my present position."</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Again</span> He took my hand and
shook it, warmly. His hair is
just a bit gray at the temples, and
there are signs of strain on His
finely featured face. Those awkward
hands are now strong and
purposeful.</p>

<p>He apologized that He must return
to His duties, and went with
me to the door. "My secretary will
fill in further details about your
new position. Newspapers shall
once again be published. No&mdash;don't
say a word, Mr. Booth! I
know what you are thinking.</p>

<p>"Your salary," he continued as
we stood at the open door, "shall,
of course, be commensurate to
your high authority in this new
field. Allow me, now, to thank
you most deeply and sincerely
for your unwitting aid in my
youth. I assure you, Mr. Booth,
I have often thought of that day
we talked. And I hope to repay
you, in some measure, for what
you did."</p>

<p>He said more, mostly polite
phrases of good-by. And then I
was outside after being handed a
folder by some man.</p>

<p>An official jetmobile took me
to my residence&mdash;which turned
out to be in the East Wing. Here
I am, and I don't understand. I
came prepared to suffer heaven
only knows what as part of Kilmer
Jones's childish pattern for
revenge.</p>

<p>Instead, here I am, head of the
Official Bulletin, titular ruler and
ruler-in-fact of the future journalism
of the world!</p>

<p>There is something behind this&mdash;I
keep feeling there is. But
what? What? Or is he truly generous,
to a degree never before
known among absolute monarchs?</p>

<hr />

<p class="rgt">February 13, 1<br />
Kyleton Palace, North America</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">I&nbsp;am</span> a suspicious and most
humble old man. I see now
that Kyle's generosity amazed
me only because I myself would
have been incapable of such an
action.</p>

<p>Just now, I fear for His Majesty.
I was right, before, when
I said there was no subtlety in
the man. He is too open, too fair,
too forgiving. A ruler with such
greatness of heart might easily
allow some small insignificant
person in too far, too close. I fear
for him!</p>

<hr />

<p class="rgt">February 14, 1<br />
Kyleton Palace, North America</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Tomorrow</span> we begin publication!
The pressroom is magnificent!
I can hardly wait. It's been
a long time since I've felt such
exuberance.</p>

<p>This afternoon I am to conduct
a conference of some eight
hundred editors! His Majesty's
secretary has sent me an outline
on Journalistic Standards, which
I shall study after lunch.</p>

<p>There was a note attached, in
His Majesty's handwriting&mdash;such
beautiful penmanship, too. "A
mere formality," it said, "for, of
course, you and I know full well
what the future of journalism
shall be, Mr. Booth."</p>

<hr />

<p class="rgt">Later&mdash;</p>

<p>How wrong can one man be
in one lifetime?</p>

<p>I wonder now <i>why</i> he changed
the calendar. I wonder now what
poor devil he destroyed then. But
<i>I'll</i> cheat him!</p>

<p>I'll cheat him yet!</p>
